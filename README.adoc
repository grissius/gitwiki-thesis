== PDF generate

`make arara` For full blown render (re-render diagrams, transform all markdown sources, bibtex and multiple xelatex passes)

`make pdf` for only minor changes (only latex + markdown, one pass)

== Requirements

Not sure it's complete.
More like notes for myself anyway.

 * xelatex (typesetting)
 * texlive-full (probably too greedy, lazy to nitpick the subpackages)
 * pandoc (for markdown to latex)
 * plantuml (for UML diagrams; must be available under this name in PATH)
