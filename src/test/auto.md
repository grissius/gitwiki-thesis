# Automatic testing

For automatic testing of the application I used the Jest[@jest] testing framework with Enzyme[@enzyme], a testing utility library for React, and Chai[@chai], an assertion library for Node.js.

The `emily-editor` utilizes the test suits in its Travis CI pipeline before preforming a deploy of the demo application and publishing to NPM.
