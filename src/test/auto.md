# Automatic testing

For automatic testing of the application the Jest [@jest] testing framework with Enzyme [@enzyme], a testing utility library for React, and Chai [@chai], an assertion library for Node.js is used.

The `emily-editor` utilizes the test suits in its Travis CI pipeline before preforming a deploy of the demo application and publishing to npm.
