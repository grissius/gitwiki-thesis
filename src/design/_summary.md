# Summary

In this chapter I went through the design process from abstract concepts to module diagrams, API definitions and even UI.
Though not covering all the components in the same level of detail, because of how vast the system is, I offered the design solutions for the most crucial problems and core components.

On the way, I have provided solution for all problems I pointed out in the previous chapter _\hyperref[chapter:state]{State-of-the-art}_.

- Uniform authorization was discussed in _\hyperref[sec:repository-providers]{Repository providers}_, where I explained how to bind the application to the Gitolite thought gitolite CLI wrapper.
- Branching model support was discussed in _\hyperref[rest-api]{REST API}_ section as well as in _\hyperref[sec:design:ui]{UI}_ section from the user perspecitve.
- Modular LML solution was proposed in _\hyperref[emily-editor]{Emily editor}_, when I went through all required features and design a sufficient abstraction of the LML module.
