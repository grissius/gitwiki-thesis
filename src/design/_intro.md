In this chapter I shall conceptually design the system and explain, how to solve the issues I pointed out in the previous chapter summary.

Firstly I shall briefly cover the evolution of basic architectural concepts of the system, as I discussed them with my supervisor.
This will lead to solution for the main issue, which is unified authorization and later I will cover the remaining issues and finally describe the main modules of the designed system, its API and the UI.
