I would like to thank my supervisor Ing. Jakub Jirutka for his everlasting interest in the developed software and for guiding me, when I found myself in the need for words of wisdom and experience.
I bless my brother, Ing. Jiří Šmolík for his patience, dedication and reviews of the text in every stage of development.
I am also grateful to my colleagues: Peter Uhnák, Maroš Špak and Petr Chmelař for cooperation on the project of designing the user interface of the editor, as well as to all who took part in the usability testing.
Last but not least, I would like to thank 9gag, for helping me to find joy in the times of dismay.
