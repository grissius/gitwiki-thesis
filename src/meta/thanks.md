I would like to thank my supervisor Ing. Jakub Jirutka for his everlasting interest in the thesis and for guiding me, when I found myself in the need for the words of wisdom and experience.
My heartfelt gratitude belongs to my brother, Ing. Jiří Šmolík for his endless patience, dedication and reviews of the text in every stage of development.
I am also grateful to my colleagues: Peter Uhnák, Maroš Špak and Petr Chmelař for cooperation on the project of designing the user interface of the editor, as well as to all who took part in the usability testing.
Last but not least, I would like to profusely thank 9gag, for helping me to find joy in the troubled times of dismay.
