# User analysis

In previous section we cracked into business process of a small department, developing a user manual for their software.
Hence I might be forced to make some fatal decisions, which are left for interpretation in the task description with great impact, let us discuss the archetypal users mentioned in business process model.

This section is a brief user persona definition.
I intentionally draw back from the lengthly formal persona definition from usability testing, since detailed persona definition would prove less useful for a one man team.
I describe system users from their perspectives, their knowledge and skills regarding the system and give them names for further convenience of the thesis, but neglect the part of persona definition regarding their personal life and whole personification of the archetypes.

The head of department is a lady called Hump and she just organizes the flow.
Her job related to the system is very limited, but includes potential access control setting.
she is also be a developer, for it's a small company.
In a scenario where Hump manages several teams access rights it might be useful to keep the settings in a configuration file with scripting potential.

The developers are programmers gentlemen called Dump and Lump.
They are working in an IDE or coding editor and are very efficient using it.
It is best to let them work in their natural environment.
Dump and Lump know selected LML by heart and are skilled at reading it from source code, as well as writing it, without fancy visualization tools.
They are familiar with VCS principals and use one on their daily bases when coding in team.

Reviewer Rump is not a developer and just checks for readability, typos, etc.
He is making subtle changes in the manual.
Rump knows the LML syntax, but prefers and easy to use tool with rendered result to read the texts in their final form.
He knows of VCS and very basic principles, but do not use it often.

Publisher with name Pump makes no changes to the pages and just downloads the repository to their workstation
and produces desired outputs using a set of maintained scripts.
