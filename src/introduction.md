# Goal

The target of the thesis is to explore the state of art of version controlled wiki systems,
find the most appropriate solution for designing a implementing a system with the special features vaguely described in this section and specified in analysis.

## What is a _wiki_?

The system is a version controlled, document oriented, text-based wiki software.

But what is a _wiki_? According to Oxford dictionaries it is a _"a website that allows any user to change or add to the information it contains"_ [@oald:wiki] a longer and certainly more entertaining description from [@wikiwikiweb:front] states _"The idea of a Wiki may seem odd at first, but dive in, explore its links and it will soon seem familiar. Wiki is a composition system; it's a discussion medium; it's a repository; it's a mail system; it's a tool for collaboration. We don't know quite what it is, but we do know it's a fun way to communicate asynchronously across the network."_.
Those are both obviously vague concepts, but set up a reasonably foundation of what wiki is.

The essential idea behind wiki has always been to put users into the role of not just mere consumers, but producers of the content, which is the true concept as well as the most commonly used example of _Web 2.0_.
Wiki is a platform for document oriented, organically created structured content.

Documents are typically managed by administrators (performing corrections, topic creation etc.) and written by a community of users.
The community users have easy access for document editing and thus it is easy to access and become a contributor.
An in-browser solution for article editing is expected, for users to collaborate,
for if users feel uncomfortable, or face a steep learning curve, they might become discouraged from their participation and then the wiki cannot thrive without updated content.

Apart from the editing interface, it is expected of a wiki to provide documents of a common topic, that binds the community of contributers.
_Wikipedia_ [@wikipedia] is an encyclopedia,
_WikiWikiWeb_ [@wikiwikiweb], often considered to be the first wiki, was designed to discuss design patterns,
or _Wiktionary_ [@wiktionary] as a community developed multilingual open dictionary are all fine examples of such trait.
